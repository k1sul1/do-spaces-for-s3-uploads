# DigitalOcean Spaces for humanmade/S3-Uploads

Change S3 settings so that uploads to Spaces work out of the box. Set S3_UPLOADS_BUCKET to the space name and S3_UPLOADS_REGION to the region it's in. 

Create a space access key, and set S3_UPLOADS_KEY & S3_UPLOADS_SECRET accordingly.

```
composer require k1sul1/do-spaces-for-s3-uploads
```
